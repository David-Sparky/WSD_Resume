HOMEWORK 1 README -- DAVID SPARKMAN -- SPARKD

Why did you select the doctype you used?

I decided to use HTML 5 because it is the latest version of HTML and because it is the format that I am most familiar with.

How does your doctype compare to other commonly seen (strict) doctypes?

How is the markup for your document semantically correct? Are there any non-semantic elements that you needed for styling
purposes? If you used divs and /or spans, be sure to account for them in your explanation.

In your own words, how is the hCard information you added useful to both humans and automated user agents trying to
access your content?

The hCard (vcard) allows automated systems to parse the HTML file and quickly find where the contact information and extract
it. Many devices and browsers now use this to give the user the option to create a contact or add to an existing contact.
This makes it easy for the user to add the information since they won't have to enter int manually.
